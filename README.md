# Language Switcher - Built in ReactJS

### Deployment: https://react-language-switcher-template.netlify.app

### Ever want to add a new language to your application but realize that you need to add modifications all over your site?

### Well this repo is an example of a solution to this problem.

Just add your new language to languages.json and boom, your new language is available throughout your application.

No more conditional rendering. No more modifying 27000 different places in your application.

You can use this template as a learning tool to see how you can apply this same pattern to any of your existing or new applications.
